# Discord Role Machine

These instructions are for communities/owners to enchant our tools to their servers.

1. First you will need to rearrange all of your roles for your users in your discord server.
2. You will need to specify to our development team your requirements for those roles.
   * [x] For example you will need to specify the amount of NFT holders in a NFT contract that will equal a role. NFT contract number - Token count - Role&#x20;
3. Invite the Vitruvians Bot to your discord server

You can submit form [https://airtable.com/shraK9IwCn07O3OFw](https://airtable.com/shraK9IwCn07O3OFw)

**Support**: We recommend that you open at least two channels in your discord role which will provide help from the Vitruvian team to your community.
