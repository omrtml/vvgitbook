# Welcome to Vitruvians Guide

Hi there! This document will guide you throughout the whole Vitruvians project and the tools we created. Hope you enjoy it!


# Introduction

NFTs exist in Oasis blockchain since the minting of AI Rose in December 2021. The first NFT mint which was sold out is Pixeloasis. Today Oasis has 30+ NFT projects (active and non-active). This number is very low compared to other leading blockchains, such as Ethereum, Solana, Near, etc. Some projects have promised developments and utilities for their NFTs but even the simplest features (like staking) did not see light.

We think there is a great demand for services which did not exist yet. If a strong infrastructure exists, NFT projects in a blockchain can grow easily and quickly.
We saw that NFT communities were craving for these services. We have seen this demand and took things one step forward. We decided to develop a platform which will cover all development services that an NFT project might need.

We started to offer our solutions in our website vitruvians.tools as a one-stop shop for all NFT communities. Meanwhile, our brand Vitruvians is also growing fast to become a well-known brand in the NFT world and a strong community itself.

# What are our advantages?

There is a dedicated and experienced team behind the Vitruvians project. We take the motto “build before mint” very seriously. We test our tools to the highest extent before we open them for public use. Our team members have strong bonds between each other. We love to work together and also have fun together. We have a genuine interest in working closely with other NFT communities.

# Why did we choose the name Vitruvians?

We are the Vitruvians, a community born in Oasis blockchain. We have chosen the iconic Vitruvian Man from Leonardo da Vinci as our identity. This famous picture is known to be the symbol for the perfect combination of art and technique. This is actually what the Vitruvian community is about: well developed, useful tools with stylish world-class artwork.

# Vitruvians Platform

## Overview

Our vision is to facilitate the use of NFTs for everybody. For this reason we developed the vitruvians.tools platform that contains a bunch of tools described in following chapters.
Tools in our belt

## Discord Role Machine

Communities often want to know who is holding their NFTs. These holders are given specific roles and are granted access to some channels within the community’s Discord server. In order to get these roles, the holder has to submit a proof of hold, which is usually done by posting a snapshot of their wallet which contains the NFT. This primitive procedure is time consuming for everybody: members have to pursue manual steps in order to prove that they are really holders and community managers have to make sure (or at least to believe) that these screenshots are genuine. 

We wanted to create a very fast, easy, reliable and foolproof tool that is called Discord Role Machine. The holders can log in to our Vitruvians platform and get their roles themselves. The Vitruvians app first asks the user to log in with their Discord and connect their wallet. We read which NFTs are held in the wallet connected, and we give the related roles to the Discord user automatically. This is the most secure and easiest way to assign roles to community members.

To use this tool, we expect the community managers to reach us and define how the roles have to be given. For example: 
holders of one NFT get the role “alpha”,
holding more than 5 NFTs will grant the role “whale”,
holders of an NFT with some specific rare attributes must get the role “deep alpha”

When a user goes out of the defined condition by selling or listing the NFT(s), his/her roles are automatically removed. This is also taken care of by the algorithm.

Our vision is clear: we want to make everybody’s life easier in the NFT world.

## Safe Transfer

The transfer of NFTs from one wallet to another is not yet an integrated function of wallets in Oasis blockchain. Today people use a platform like an NFT marketplace to do this. With our “Safe Transfer” tool it can be done in a simple and secure way. We plan to extend the functionality to this tool in the future, by making it possible to send more than one NFT at once.
Important! 
Before you click “Transfer” please remember to check ALWAYS the first and last 3 digits of the wallet address you paste. You may have malicious software in your computer that hacks your clipboard and may paste another address instead of the one you copied.
 
## Stake as a Service

Nowadays many projects include staking in their roadmaps. This is done in order to reward holders. In exchange for not selling their NFTs, holders get a portion of the project’s token for each NFT that they have not listed for sale. 
We made it simple again for project managers and users. Collections can use our vitruvians.tools platform to stake their NFTs and earn their community tokens. Default vesting period is one day. Users are supposed to connect their wallets to the platform and claim tokens any time they like.

## Rarity

Another service we are proud of. You can see all NFTs in a collection listed in descending order of rarity. Simple and useful.

## Season

All NFTs are valuable and we value them all. All Oasis NFTs can receive $VITRU tokens from Vitruvians on a seasonal basis. A season can be a period of time (like a month), an achievement or a milestone (like completion of a project’s Phase 1). Each season, each NFT can collect its seasonal earnings once. Follow the Vitruvians for more.

## Market

This section is where we offer valuables for sale, such as NFTs, whitelist tokens, raffle tickets, etc.

## Dex

This is the place where users can buy or sell $VITRU token.

## Sales and Listings Bot

We prepared a bot for all sales and listings for the NFTs in Oasis blockchain. When an NFT is sold or listed in a marketplace followers can see it both in Twitter and Discord instantly.




# Tokenomics of Vitruvians

## Introduction

The concept of “tokenization” brought so many new features to the world. Many projects wanted to give value to their utilities with tokens they created. Those tokens are distributed mostly as a “reward” for escrow. Sometimes the projects share their ownership with token holders, by attributing a “share” of the project to token holders.

People began to feel the inflation created by the unbalanced excess value produced during the Covid19 pandemic, with the change in the prices of the products they bought from the markets. Informally, inflation became perceivable when the price of products bought from the shelf was not the same when people wanted to buy it again. The lack of an equal increase in wages meant that the purchasing power of people weakened, which was the steps of the great shrinkage in stock and crypto markets as the society sold their valuable products in their hands.

With its limited supply structure Bitcoin is seen as one of the most resistant assets against inflation over the years. Bitcoin rewards those who provide security to the blockchain (i.e. miners). It also aimed to slow down the increase in supply by halving these rewards every 4 years. This will turn it into an asset that cannot be produced any more after a while, making it a limited product.

First supporters of every major project have been the top earners as they have been partners in its growth. In the first years, Bitcoin was produced continuously by these early adopters who believed in the project. Later on there were many more players who continuously mined Bitcoin. Although its supply was constantly increasing, Bitcoin’s value reached its peaks due to the increase in demand.

## The $VITRU Token

We created the tokenomics of $VITRU with the aim to reward not only the investors of our project, but also the supporters of the whole Oasis ecosystem. 

While $VITRU is introduced as an over-inflationary token, it will also come with a maximalist burning mechanism that will balance the inflationary structure. With the growth of the community and the projects that will be added to the ecosystem, the burn mechanism will be used very aggressively in every stage. We aim to build a large community, in which all the privileges that future projects bring can be purchased with $VITRU. Therefore, everyone who owns $VITRU will have a chance to take advantage of the opportunities that will be offered.

Total supply of $VITRU is 1 billion tokens. These are planned to be allocated as shown below.



Each OG NFT will provide 200 $VITRU per day to the staker, until the mint day of our second collection. The second collection will also earn $VITRU (the amount to be declared later). If we manage to distribute all our $VITRU tokens to Vitruvians collection holders in full efficiency, we plan to distribute 60M tokens per year. There are also 30M tokens to be distributed to stakers of other NFT collections every year. The amount which cannot be distributed will be burned. 

We plan to have a maximum of 100M $VITRU tokens in circulation by the end of the first year after the TGE. Please note that the majority of these will be collected back to be burned.

Token distribution schedule over the years is as follows.



Marketing: A good project deserves a well-planned marketing campaign. The goal is to use these tokens for marketing purposes. If they are not used by the end of each defined period, they will be burned. 
Staking: Staking is one of the core utilities of $VITRU. Tokens can be obtained by staking Vitruvian NFTs.
Other NFTs: We embrace and value all NFT collections in Oasis. Tokens in this section will be given to stakers of NFTs from other projects in Oasis. $VITRU assigned in Season utility will also be claimed from this section.
Dex Offering & Liquidity: These are the tokens that will be issued if we decide to create a liquidity pool in a Dex. If we decide not to do it, all tokens accumulated in this section will be burned.
Reserve: These are the tokens reserved to be used in case of any situation we could not predict. Normally it is expected that these tokens do not go to the circulation. In case these tokens are not used, they will be burned.
Team: Tokens reserved for the team. Every team member will be free to decide personally, if they will sell or hold their share of tokens.

The most important feature of our $VITRU token is the burn mechanics. Each $VITRU which is used in the ecosystem will be collected in a specific wallet whose only aim is to burn these tokens. Events will be organized from time to time to announce burning. Therefore, the circulation at the end of each year will actually be much less than what is indicated in the distribution schedule. Thanks to our extremely aggressive burn policy, it will not be possible for all these tokens to remain in circulation. At the end of each year, we plan to decide together with the community what we can do with the tokens that have remained.

We have more plans for the Vitruvians ecosystem. Despite the fact that it is an inflationary token, $VITRU will not always be easy to find. There will be many attractive opportunities for holders to use the tokens. Using means burning. If the community doesn't want to sell it, $VITRU will naturally remain valuable.
