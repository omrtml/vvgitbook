### **Safe Transfer**

**The safe transfer tool is one of our most needed tools. It’s very simple in what it does and why you need it. You can basically send your nft's to anyone. As you will see the tool interacts with the nft contract itself. Whenever you've clicked on the send nft button it will ask for an wallet which will lead you to an interaction with Metamask on the blockchain. You will be able to read everything what will happen in the next steps within the interaction. That's why we call it a safe transfer. This is how you can use it:**

1\. Visit [https://vitruvians.tools/](https://vitruvians.tools/) and click to "Launch App" in the right upper-corner.

2\. Link your Metamask Wallet.

3\. You will be able to see all your nft's after you have linked your wallet.

4\. Click on the send nft button.

5\. Insert the designated wallet address and hit the sumbit button afterwards.

6\. Follow the interaction with Metamask and complete the transaction.

{% hint style="danger" %}
<mark style="color:red;">**IMPORTANT:**</mark> You are solely responsible for any mistake made by inserting the wrong wallet address or not following the interaction correctly within Metamask itself. Metamask gives the opportunity to cancel the transaction untill you have confirmed the last section of the transaction.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Hint**: Always double check your designated wallet address, even after the Vitruvian tool you can still follow it in the Metamask screen.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
**Support tip**: If you have difficulties with using the Metamask window or if it's your first experience with a transaction using Metamask, be aware that you can **always** ask our <mark style="color:green;">Support Team</mark> for any help that you might need.
{% endhint %}

### Stake as a Service

**Our main idea of supplying our token will be with staking. Every nft project owner can apply for the staking tool and if its been approved it will lead to a point where all those nft holders for that project can stake it in our system and earn our erc20 token.**

<mark style="color:blue;">**There will me more information available as soon as the tool is in action!**</mark>

### **Vitruvian Market**

**You will be able to buy items here, and as a sneak peek we will be telling you that you will be able to buy our whitelists soon in our Vitruvian market. Let’s take our whitelist sales as an example and see how it will work. Whenever a buyer buys the whitelist it will automatically collect the buyers wallet address, so it can be used later for minting. This feature will also make it available for users or communities to use the market in other ways. Such as a lottery draw application for your community. This is how you will access the market:**

1\. Visit [https://vitruvians.tools/](https://vitruvians.tools/) and click to "Launch App" in the right upper-corner.

2\. Link your Metamask Wallet.

3\. Select the Market on your left menu.
