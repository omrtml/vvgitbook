# Welcome to the Vitruvians Guide.

## What's the purpose of our project?

Our main purpose is to develop the ecosystem of Oasis itself, besides the network our goal here is to take all the communities within the system to another level. We have a great team which fully deploys from our community. With that power in hand we are already aware of the needs in our network and of those communities.\
\
We'll be helping other communities with our tools. Our tools are ready for use but as we are trying to develop the network, we develop as well. So that means that there will be developing tools continuously throughout this road. With the feedbacks from each community or individual we will continue to detect the needs.

## Why did we choose the Vitruvians

We are the Vitruvians, a community born in Oasis blockchain. We have chosen the iconic Vitruvian Man from Leonardo da Vinci as our identity. This famous picture is known to be the symbol for the perfect combination of art and technique. This is actually what the Vitruvian community is about: well developed, useful tools with stylish world-class artwork
